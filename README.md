# Homework Assignment 18

![Assignment 18](https://github.com/PGE323M/assignment18-solution/workflows/.github/workflows/assignment18.yml/badge.svg)

## Instructions

Work through the [Project 2 CMG Tutorial](https://youtu.be/0wFy36pjdX8) (note the wells from [project2](https://github.com/PGE323M/project2) are in slightly different locations from where they are in the video) and import your results into CMG's Results 3D application.  From there, export the pressures as shown in the [2D tutorial](https://youtu.be/4UGY74SJZ-o) at the **end of day 200**.  The "Export Properties" menu is now located and clearly labeled at the top of the main menu of the Results application. Save the exported results to a file `assignment18.txt`.  Copy this file into this repository, add, commit, and push to Github for submission.

## Testing

If you would like to check to see if your solution is correct, run the following command at the Terminal command line:

```bash
python test.py
```
